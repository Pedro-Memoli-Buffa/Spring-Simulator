# Spring-Simulator
Set any spring-mass configuration on a 2D plane and see how it evolves. 

Currently all masses are 5kg, the spring constant is 6 and the natural length of springs is 0.

Press right click to set a mass, left click to connect two masses with a spring, and middle click to create an unmovable mass.
Enter starts/pauses the simulation.

TODO: 
Display the instructions.
Add the possiblity of changing masses, spring constants and natural length of springs both generally and individually.
Be clear about the units.
